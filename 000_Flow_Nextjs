Layouts in Next.js App Router
In the app/ directory, files like layout.tsx and page.tsx have special meanings:
* layout.tsx: Defines UI that persists across pages (like headers, footers, sidebars).
* page.tsx: The actual page content.





Given this structure:

CopyEdit
app/
  layout.tsx
  page.tsx



Next.js starts from the root of the app/ directory.
1.It first loads and renders layout.tsx.
2.nside layout.tsx, there's usually a special placeholder:
tsx
CopyEdit
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>{children}</body>  // ðŸ‘ˆ children will be your `page.tsx`
    </html>
  )
}



3.Next.js now renders page.tsx and passes it into the children prop of layout.tsx.
4.So the layout wraps the page like this:
tsx
CopyEdit
<Layout>
  <Page />
</Layout>

Why layout.tsx gets called first?
Because itâ€™s treated as the shell for that route. Think of it like:
* layout.tsx defines what stays consistent.
* page.tsx defines what changes per route.
* Next.js knows to nest page.tsx inside layout.tsx when building the HTML for the route.
