React Server Components-

Its a new architecture introduced by the react team and adopted by next js

We divide the react components into 2 types-

React server components

React client components

____________

Server components

By default all components are server components
These components can perform server side task like reading files or fetching data directly from a database

They can t use hooks or handle client operations



Client components-


For creating client components use - ‘’use client’’ directive at the top of your component file

They can’t perform server side tasks but can handle user interactions and use hooks

Client components are the traditional components we are familiar with
