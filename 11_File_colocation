File Colocation-
______________________

Next js uses file based routing

Routes becomes only public accessible if add page.tsx inside it, if we don’t page.tsx - we get 404 error

In page.tsx the browser only gets it when its default exported react component , with our default - default export is not a react component



Each folder represent a segment

It needs to have page.tsx file for the route to render and the component needs to be default export

Ex. Employee folder — needs tp have page.tsx file for rating to work for localhost/employee else we get 404

If not default export again we get error


We can have other .tsx files too which we can use it

Both file inside the employee directory

Page.tsx-

import Slave from "./employee"

export  default function  Employee(){
    return(
        <>
        this is employee main comopnent
        
        <br />
        <Slave />
        </>
    )
}




____________

Slave.tsx inside the same directory- 

export default function Slave(){
    return (
        <>
        this is the slave funtion getting called
        </>
    )
}
