Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where a web page is generated on the server at the time of a request and then sent to the client (browser) as a fully rendered HTML page. This improves performance, SEO, and the initial page load experience
compared to traditional client-side rendering.

How SSR Works in Next.js
Next.js makes it easy to implement SSR using the getServerSideProps function.

When a request is made to an SSR page:

The Next.js server processes the request.
It fetches any necessary data.
It generates the final HTML page dynamically.
The fully rendered page is sent to the browser.
