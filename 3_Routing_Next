Routing-
________________

Next js has a file system based routing system


Urls you access in browser is. determined on how your file and folder are organised 
_____________________________________________


Convention to follow

1. All routes must lie inside the app folder
2. Route file must have page.js or page.tsx extension
3. Each folder represents segment of url path


______________________’
‘

1.We can delete the app folder
2.Create new app folder -
3.Create page.jx file inside app folder-
This will be default route
For other routing create folder inside app - about - page.tsx

Inside again page.tsx-
const About = () => <>this is the about page</>

export default About;

Inside app folder create help folder


Inside again page.tsx-

const Help = () => <>This is th help page</>


export default Help
___________


 So in browser with 


http://localhost:3000 - page.tsx inside app gets called



http://localhost:3000/help - help folder page.tsx gets called


http://localhost:3000/about - about folder  page.tsx gets called




And there us default 404 provided
