CSR - SSR - Suspense SSR



Suspense SSR issue-

1. Large bundle size causing excessive downloads.
2. Un necessary hydration  delaying interactivity
3. Heavy client side processing

RSC - React server components -


New architecture designed by react team

Leverages the strength of both client and server environments to optimise efficiency and load times.

This architecture introduces a dual component model-
1. Server components
2. Client components

The distinction is not on components functionality but the execution environment 


_________________________________


Client component -


Typical react components

They are rendered on the client side (csr) but they can be rendered to html on server , allowing the user to see the screen immediately rather than a blank screen


Client components can be rendered to htm on server

Optimization strategy


They operate on client side but should also run once on server for better performance 

Client components have full access to the client environment, such as browser, use state, effects and event listeners

Can access browser api - like geo location api or locastorage

Server components -


New type of react components designed to run only on server

Unlike client components their code states on server and is never downloaded to the client

Benefits for server components -


Smaller building size

As server components stay on server  all their dependency stay on server too, so we donâ€™t need to download , parse and execute the javascript for them


No hydration step


We get direct access to server resources

They can access data bases , file systems making the data fetching efficient without client processing


Use server power to compute heavy tasks, security also benefits

Improve performance as data fetching and data base are near server


caching


First initial load and first content full paint


Seo opeimistaion

Efficient streaming



_____________________


So react server components take care of data fetching and static rendering 

While client component takes care of rending interactive elements


We get best of both server and client rendering

The app router in next.js is built entirely on rsc architecture
