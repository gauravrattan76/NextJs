Initial Rendering lifecycyle

Initial loading sequence of rsc


1. Browser send a request to server(next js and react librrary)
2. Next js matched the server component  and cals react to render server components
3. React render sc component and prepare client component tree instructions and send rsc payload to next js , next js generates html
4. Next js streams static html to browser and rsc payload
5. On browser we progressively render ui
6. Selective hydration to see full interactive ui
