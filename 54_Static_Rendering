Rendering strategies in Next js-

1. Static Rendering
2. Dynamic Rendering
3. Streaming


______________________________________


Static rendering is a strategy where html is generated at build time

Along with the html, rsc payloads for components and javascript chunks for client side hydration is are created


Direct route visit serve html files


Client side navigation uses rsc payloads and javascript chunks without additional server api request


next pre fetch the data for the routes
_____________________


If we navigate via link - we use rsc payloads and js chunks


If we hit refresh we get html files
