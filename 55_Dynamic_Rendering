Dynamic Rendering-
_____________________________


It’s a strategy where html is generated at request time.


Next js automatically enables it when it encounters dynamic features like - cookies , headers, connection, search params prop


Dynamic rendering is a server rendering strategy  where routes are rendered uniquely for each user when they make a request

It is useful when we need to show personalised data or information that’s available at request time only


Best for personalised content like social medial etc

Since we use cookies its dynamically rendered



import {cookies} from 'next/headers'

export default async function About(){
console.log("aboubt server component getting called");
const cookiestore = await cookies();

const theme = cookiestore.get('theme')
console.log('theme is', theme)
    return(
        <>
        This is the about compnent getting called
        </>
    )
}

In build we can see
