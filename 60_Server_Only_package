Server only code -
__________________________

Npm I server-only

import 'server-only'

export const  ServerUtils = () =>{
  console.log('this is server component getting caled')
  return 'server component returns here'
    }
    
______________________________________
Use import ‘server-only’ at the top of server function


It leads to build issue if you use it in client components


 You're importing a component that needs "server-only". That only works in a Server Component but one of its parents is marked with "use client", so it's a Client Component.

__________________________________
 Some code is for the server only 


Since js modules can be shared between server and client components code meant for server can accidentally go to the client


Can bloat js bundle and lead to security issues

_____________________________________


Always keep server only code from client code


Server-only package

________________________________________

We create a server side function-
If we create. A server side function and refer it inside client component we get the server function on client which can increase bundle size and lead to performance issues



ServerUtils file-


export const  ServerUtils = () =>{
  console.log('this is server component getting caled')
  return 'server component returns here'
    }
    


Client side code-

"use client"
import {ServerUtils} from '@/app/utils/serverutils'

const  ClienRoute = () =>{
const data = ServerUtils();
return(
    <>
    This is client component getting called
    <br />
    value rendered is : {data}
    </>
)
}

export default ClienRoute



Sevrer code-

import { ServerUtils } from "../utils/serverutils"

const  ServerRoute = () =>{
    const data = ServerUtils();
return(
    <>
    This is server component getting called
    <br />
    data is {data}
    </>
)
}

export default ServerRoute
